<p>HAXsite is what you are viewing currently. It is a single site that can operate stand alone or in the larger HAXcms context. A site has everything it needs to function by itself on the front-end. The HAXcms backend comes in to make the files writable.</p>
<p>Treating the site like it is a self-contained folder / file format allows for HAX to achieve it's primary goal of being a ubiquitous web authoring platform. This is because everything needed to power the site lives within the folder the site resides in. The "database" structure is handled by the <code>site.json</code> file powering the site, the content of the pages live under <code>/pages/</code> and the template leveraged for the site's design comes from the same web component infrastructure as the blocks that make up the page.</p>

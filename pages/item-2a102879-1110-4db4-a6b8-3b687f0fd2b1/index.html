<p>Installation and management of HAXiam have scripts to help with their setup just like other parts of the HAX ecosystem</p>
<h2 id="header-ee72b742-e7ed-6967-8aa5-c770fde047c8">Installation</h2>
<ul><li>To install dependencies on the server to ensure smooth setup, <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/HAXiam/blob/master/scripts/ubuntu20.04.sh" target="_blank">this ubuntu configuration script is provided</a></li><li>Installing HAXiam involves this script: <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/HAXiam/blob/master/scripts/whateveryousayiam.sh" target="_blank" role="textbox">iamwhateveryousayiam.sh</a></li></ul>

<p>HAXiam allows for empowering users to create sites but in order to ensure they don't step on each other's namespaces, addresses can get kind of long. This is by design to support a multi-tenant environment for building the site, but often is annoying when sharing addresses out to others. That's where vanity domains come in, though they require server configuration.</p>
<ul><li>Create a valid apache record for the domain and where to point in the HAXiam instance</li><li>Include the following environmental variable: </li></ul>

<p>Both HAXiam as well as HAXcms can have customization applied to HAXiam's configure directory in order to ensure maintainable upgrades of both the core platform as well as HAXcms which it is managing a copy of.</p>
<p>Example implementations of these files are written into <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/HAXiam/tree/master/system/boilerplate/systemsetup" target="_blank">new instances at the time the system is created and can be found here.</a></p>

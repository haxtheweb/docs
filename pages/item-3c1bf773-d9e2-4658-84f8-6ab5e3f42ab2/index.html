  <p slot="col-1"><b>Consider this:</b> the single most important guideline for maximizing student
    attention to a video is to keep the duration short. Student engagement (and the willingness
    to watch it in its entirety) drops off quickly as duration lengthens. Exceed 12 minutes
    and risk having only 20% of your students watch the video! Researchers also found
    that mind wandering increased with duration, and that information retention decreased. <b>Keep it short!</b> Six
    to nine minutes is ideal.</p>

<p>Another method to keep students engaged is to u<span>se a conversational style. Called the personalization principle by Mayer, the use
  of conversational rather than formal language during multimedia instruction has been
  shown to have a large effect on studentsâ€™ learning, perhaps because a conversational
  style encourages students to develop a sense of social partnership with the narrator
  that leads to greater engagement and effort (Mayer, 2008).</span></p>

<p>In addition, some research suggests that it can be important for video narrators
  to <i>speak relatively quickly and with enthusiasm</i>. In their study examining student
  engagement with MOOC videos, Guo and colleagues observed that student engagement
  was dependent on the narrator&#8217;s speaking rate, with student engagement increasing
  as speaking rate increased (Guo <i>et al</i>., 2014). It can be tempting for video
  narrators to speak slowly to help ensure that students grasp important ideas, but
  including in-video questions, &#8220;chapters,&#8221; and speed control can give students control over this feature.</p>

 students (avoid repurposing).</h2>
<p>Instructors can also promote student engagement with educational videos by creating
  or packaging them in a way that conveys that <i>the material is for </i><i>these </i><i>students in </i><i>this </i><i>class</i>. One of the benefits for instructors in using educational videos can be the ability
  to reuse them for other classes and other semesters. When creating or choosing videos,
  however, it is important to consider whether they were created for the type of environment
  in which they will be used. For example, a face-to-face classroom session that is
  videotaped and presented within an online class may feel less engaging than a video
  that is created with an online environment as the initial target (Guo <i>et al</i>.,
  2014). A video&#8217;s adaptability can be enhanced, however: when reusing videos, instructors
  can package them for a particular class using text outside the video to contextualize
  the relevance for that particular class and lesson.</p>

    and risk having only 20% of your students watch the video! Researchers also found
    that mind wandering increased with duration, and that information retention also decreased. Six
    to nine minutes is an ideal duration for video.</p>

<p>In Mayers' <i>Twelve Principles of Multimedia Learning, </i>this is known as the personalization principle. Research has shown that using conversational language (rather than formal language) during multimedia instruction accounts for a significant positive impact on student learning.&#160; While the relationship is not entirely clear, it may be that a conversational style helps students to "socially partner" with the narrator, leading to greater engagement and effort.<br><br>Placing the student in the lesson by use of &#8220;your&#8221; rather than &#8220;the&#8221; during explanations Use of &#8220;I&#8221; to indicate the narrator&#8217;s perspective<br></p>

<p>In addition, some research suggests that it can be important for video narrators to speak relatively quickly and with enthusiasm. In their study examining student engagement with MOOC videos, Guo and colleagues observed that student engagement was dependent on the narrator&#8217;s speaking rate, with student engagement increasing as speaking rate increased (Guo et al., 2014). It can be tempting for video narrators to speak slowly to help ensure that students grasp important ideas, but including in-video questions, &#8220;chapters,&#8221; and speed control can give students control over this feature&#8212;and increasing narrator speed appears to promote student interest.<br><br>Speaking rates in the 185&#8211;254 words per minute range Expressions of instructor excitement, such as &#8220;I love the next part; the way the feed-forward mechanism works is so elegant,&#8221; or &#8220;Consider how the cell solves this tricky problem of needing to regulate three genes in sequence; it&#8217;s really cool.&#8221;<br></p>

 students (avoid repurposing).</h2>
<p>Instructors can also promote student engagement with educational videos by creating or packaging them in a way that conveys that the material is for these students in this class. One of the benefits for instructors in using educational videos can be the ability to reuse them for other classes and other semesters. When creating or choosing videos, however, it is important to consider whether they were created for the type of environment in which they will be used. For example, a face-to-face classroom session that is videotaped and presented within an online class may feel less engaging than a video that is created with an online environment as the initial target (Guo et al., 2014). A video&#8217;s adaptability can be enhanced, however: when reusing videos, instructors can package them for a particular class using text outside the video to contextualize the relevance for that particular class and lesson.<br><br>Videos created for the class in which they are going to be used, with instructor narration explaining links to preceding material Explanatory text to situate video in course<br></p>

<p>HAXsite is the site as a folder which includes everything needed to render your content. Everything created works as a stand alone or as powered by a CDN. It's contents become editable when HAXcms is present and the user is authenticated / authorized to edit the content. Then the editing tools magically appear to make your static site editable. All changes are written back static to the HAXsite so that you can download it and take it with you elsewhere at any time.</p>
<p>This section documents aspects of custom and core development.</p>

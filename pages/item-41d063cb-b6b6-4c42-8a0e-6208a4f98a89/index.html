<p>HAXcms, that which powers the site you are currently reading is a powerful "static site generator" paradigm. It leverages server technology in order to orchestrate a static site. That way the "server" is only used when needed for a user to securely develop their content.</p>

<p>Unlike solutions like Jekyll<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" role="textbox"></a> , HAXcms is for anyone to publish a website, not just those that understand command line. HAXcms is intended to be installed and then allow users to entirely use a UI to create, publish and manage micro-sites.</p>

<p>ELMS Learning Network (ELMSLN) is an open source educational technology platform for building and sustaining innovation in course technologies. It is not a traditional LMS but a Next Generation Digital Learning Environment (NGDLE) that utilizes a Suite of Tools approach to course design. Think Google Apps but for colleges, institutions or even individual professors to run and control a course that best meets their needs to effectively teach their topics. An ecosystem of educational technologies that know how to work together, utilize industry standards like REST, xAPI and LTI(1.2) and can grow infinitely because of the philosophy of the design (yes, infinitely). Each course forms a network of technologies (hence the name Learning Network) which can then be better tailored to each individual course's needs.</p>
<p>ELMS:LN as both idea and platform has been developed and in use since 2012 to power the content and experiences of 100s of online courses at Penn State and beyond. In 2020 HAXcms matured to the point that it began to replace ELMS:LN's design layer. By 2022 all direct development on ELMS:LN effectively stopped as all new capabilities were added into HAX, which was then loaded on top of ELMS:LN.</p>
<p>ELMS:LN is effectively in legacy. It is still used but all new development happens in HAX and then is backported via a script to make these capabilities available in ELMS:LN. It is effectively feature and version complete yet will continue to get updates via HAXcms for awhile given the unique way the integration was executed (tricking HAXcms front-end into thinking that Drupal is serving it static files).</p>

<p>MacHardy and Pardos (2015) have developed a model relating educational video characteristics to students&#8217; performance on subsequent assessments. One observation from their analysis of Khan Academy videos was that videos that offered the greatest benefits to students were highly relevant to associated exercises. This result is supported by results observed in a &#8220;teaching- as-research&#8221; project at Vanderbilt University (for background on teaching as research, see www.cirtl.net). Specifically, Faizan Zubair participated in the BOLD Fellows program, in which graduate students develop online learning materials for incorporation into a faculty mentor&#8217;s course and then investigate their impact in teaching-as-research projects. Zubair developed videos on that were embedded in a larger homework assignment in Paul Laibinis&#8217;s chemical engineering class and found that students valued the videos and that the videos improved students&#8217; understanding of difficult concepts when compared with a semester when the videos were not used in conjunction with the homework (Zubair and Laibinis, 2015; see also Summary).</p>

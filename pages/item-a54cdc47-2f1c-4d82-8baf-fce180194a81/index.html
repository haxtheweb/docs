<p>A 2013 research study in mathematics compared the test performance of two groups
  of students. The first group answered questions posed between video lecture "chunks"
  of approximately 5 minutes in length. The second group completed unrelated arithmetic
  problems between the same video segments. This research showed the students in the
  first group performed significantly better on subsequent tests of the material compared
  to the second group. These students also reported less mind wandering, exhibited
  increased note taking, described the learning as less &#8220;mentally taxing,&#8221; and reported
  reduced test anxiety.</p>
<p>Why does this strategy of "interjected questions" work?</p>
<ul><li>It optimizes cognitive load by:</li><ul><li>Decreasing extraneous load (i.e., anxiety about an upcoming test)</li><li>Increasing germane load (i.e., note taking, reduced mind wandering)</li></ul><li>It taps into the “testing effect”; the act of recalling important information assists memorization and the ability to use what has been learned​</li><li>It helps students engage in more accurate self-assessment.</li></ul>
<p>HAX now supports a variety of question formats that you can use to apply this guideline.</p>

<p>Zhang and colleagues compared the impact of interactive and noninteractive video
  on students&#8217; learning in a computer science course (Zhang et al., 2006). Students
  who were able to control movement through the video, selecting important sections
  to review and moving backward when desired, demonstrated better achievement of learning
  outcomes and greater satisfaction. One simple way to achieve this level of interactivity
  is by using YouTube Annotate, HapYak, or another tool to introduce labeled &#8220;chapters&#8221;
  into a video. This not only has the benefit of giving students control but also can
  demonstrate the organization, increasing the germane load of the lesson.</p>

<p>Lawson and colleagues examined the impact of guiding questions on students&#8217; learning
  from a video about social psychology in an introductory psychology class (Lawson
  et al., 2006). Building on work from Kreiner (1997), they had students in some sections
  of the course watch the video with no special instructions, while students in other
  sections of the course were provided with eight guiding questions to consider while
  watching. The students who answered the guiding questions while watching the video
  scored significantly higher on a later test. Guiding questions may serve as an implicit
  means to share learning objectives with students, thus increasing the germane load
  of the learning task and reducing the extraneous load by focusing student attention
  on important elements. This strategy is often used to increase student learning from
  reading assignments (e.g., Tanner, 2012; Round and Campbell, 2013), and it can translate
  effectively to helping students learn from video.</p>

<p>MacHardy and Pardos (2015) have developed a model relating educational video characteristics
  to students&#8217; performance on subsequent assessments. One observation from their analysis
  of Khan Academy videos was that videos that offered the greatest benefits to students
  were highly relevant to associated exercises. This result is supported by results
  observed in a &#8220;teaching- as-research&#8221; project at Vanderbilt University (for background
  on teaching as research, see www.cirtl.net). Specifically, Faizan Zubair participated
  in the BOLD Fellows program, in which graduate students develop online learning materials
  for incorporation into a faculty mentor&#8217;s course and then investigate their impact
  in teaching-as-research projects. Zubair developed videos on that were embedded in
  a larger homework assignment in Paul Laibinis&#8217;s chemical engineering class and found
  that students valued the videos and that the videos improved students&#8217; understanding
  of difficult concepts when compared with a semester when the videos were not used
  in conjunction with the homework (Zubair and Laibinis, 2015; see also Summary).</p>

<p>Documentation is being rebuilt around End User Documentation as well as different levels of development based on what part of HAX you are looking to interface with. While we restructure this material feel free to fallback on the following resources for things unique to different parts of the project:</p>
<ul><li ="true"=""><a href="https://haxtheweb.org/" target="_blank">Developing for HAX</a>
</li>
<li ="true"=""><a href="https://elmsln.github.io/hax11ty/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HAX11ty</a>
</li>
<li ="true"=""><a href="https://wcfactory.js.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WCFactory</a>
</li>
</ul>

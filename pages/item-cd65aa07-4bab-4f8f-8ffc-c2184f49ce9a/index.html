<p>edtechjoker is the code name for class projects in IST 256 where student final projects are to take a shared issue from the issue queue and work to try and achieve that. This gives students real world working experience on a real problem and in some cases their code reaches a level where it is ingested directly into the project! These are some examples of this</p>
<ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li>FA21 - 5th - </li><li>FA19 - 1st - The tip of the spear. This class gave UX feedback on a new CMS called HAXcms which was highly experimental. They were to create sites using the platform and give UX feedback. This was instrumental in initially illustrating that the concept was viable.</li></ul>
